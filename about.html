<h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            Turkey history spans thousands of years, beginning <br>with ancient civilizations such as the
            Hittites, Lydians, and Phrygians. <br>It later became the center of the powerful Roman and Byzantine
            Empires.
            In 1299,<br> the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> was founded and became one of the most influential
            empires <br>in the world, lasting over 600 years. After World War I, the Republic of Turkey was<br>
            established in 1923 by <strong>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</strong>, who modernized the nation.

    <p>The historical region that is now Turkey was known as Anatolia. The name "Turkey" itself derives
         from the Medieval Latin "Turchia," a term used to refer to the land of the Turkic people, which was
          adopted by the Ottoman Empire and eventually became the official name of the modern republic</p>
